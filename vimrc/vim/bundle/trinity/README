[Introduction]

This small plugin is just an IDE manager to control the three plugins open and close, and build them into a great IDE which works like the Source Insignt.
I will just update trinity.vim file only since V1.3 and above.

[Features]

1\ Automatic Display of Declarations in the Context Window on the bottom in the (G)VIM window using the script named 'Source Explorer(srcexpl.vim)' :

2\ Symbol Windows For Each File on the left in the (G)VIM window (G)VIM using the script named 'taglist.vim':

3\ Quick Access to All Files on the right in the (G)VIM window using the script named 'The NERD tree(NERD_tree.vim)':

4\ You can change various options of each plugin in trinity.vim according to you request.

[Declaration]

In order to build such an IDE that implement the main functions(function list, definition and context explorer, file brower), I had modified the source code of 'NERD_tree.zip 2.13.0'. You would note the tag named 'CHE Wenlong delete/add  for trinity.vim' in the NERD_tree.vim.
