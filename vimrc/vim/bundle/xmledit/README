This script provides some convenience when editing XML (and some SGML including
HTML) formated documents. It allows you to jump to the beginning or end of the
tag block your cursor is in. '%' will jump between '<' and '>' within the tag
your cursor is in. When in insert mode and you finish a tag (pressing '>') the
tag will be completed. If you press '>' twice it will complete the tag and
place the cursor in the middle of the tags on it's own line.
